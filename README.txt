Code for simulation and case study: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19118 


run_simu_concATE* and plot_concATE* contain R code for estimators, simulations and plots — used to generate figures 3-5

* stoch: considers V_k a stochastic function of E (instead of a deterministic function of E) — used to generate plots of Figure 5

* n100: considers a sample size of n=100 — figures in the appendix

* K2: considers 2 treatment arms in addition to a shared control arm — used to generate tables in the appendix


case_study_ACTT and test_omnibus contain R code for the case study

We also provide figures and simulation Rdata.
